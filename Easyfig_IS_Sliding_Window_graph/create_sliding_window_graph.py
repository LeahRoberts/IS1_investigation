# Sliding Window Script

# Author: Leah Roberts (Scott Beatson Lab)
# Date: 05-09-14

# This script is designed to iteratively count the number of genes 
# within a predefined window size. The output is a csv file, which 
# gives the start and end location of the window, as well as the
# number of specified genes within that region.
# This csv file can also be easily parsed into a single text file 
# suitable as input into EasyFig. Input into Easyfig will result 
# in a graph above the genome figure corresponding to the number 
# of genes in each window across the genome. 

# To parse the results to a text file for EasyFig, type:
### cat results.txt | cut -f3 -d, > results_easyfig.txt

import glob
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.SeqFeature import FeatureLocation


# The infile need to be in a directory named "Genomes"
# The infile needs to be in embl format

in_files = glob.glob('Genomes/*.embl')	

# Defines the window size that the script will move through
# This can be changed based on preference, but will make
# the script run slower.
		
window_size = 100000

	cur_genome = SeqIO.parse(f, "embl")			# Parses the input file
	for record in cur_genome:
		print "infile = %s" % (record.description)	# Prints the name of the infile (can also be "record.id")
		sequence_length = len(record)
		start_pos = 1					# Defines the starting position
		end_of_line = len(record) - window_size		# Defines the end of the "sliding window"	
	
		# Define the end position:
		# The end position is either:
			# The start position + the window size; or
			# The very end of the sequence (if the start position moves 
			# within the last sliding window region)

			print_counter += 100			# This counts the number of positions that have been iterated through
			
			# The 'if' statement below is used to check that the script is still working
			# As described above, the print_counter variable tracks the number of positions
			# that have been iterated through.
			# Once the print counter reaches 500000 (or any predefined number), it prints 
			# a working statement.
			# The counter then resets to zero, and the counting starts over again.
